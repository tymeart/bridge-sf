  "description": "Join us at the Upload Collective for the second Art + VR Event on Tuesday, September 20th.\n\nAfter such a great turn out at the last Art event at the Collective, we've decided to continue the series. Rather than just limiting the tech art to Virtual Reality, we have decided to include any art related to tech. This mission of bridging the gap between the tech world and the art world is a new mission that the H.E.art Project (The Home Endevor Art Project) has been born out of. This is a program designed to be funded by tech companies to help provide subsidized housing and gallery space to artists in the Bay Area, that are being pushed out due to gentrification, and thus keeping art within the city.\n\nThere will be an Art Talk followed by a presentation from Stuart Mason and his partner, Samuel Finn, discussing their vision for the H.E.art Project.\n\nWe will have a silent auction, virtual reality demos on Samsung Gear VRs,  HTC Vive experiences and art installations.\n\nFood and drinks will be provided.\n\nAll proceeds go directly to H.E.art Project.\n\nwww.heartprojectsf.com\nwww.uploadvr.com\n\n_______________________________\n\nPartnership/ demo/ press inquiries: Olya@UploadVR.com, Ned@UploadVR.com\nArt inquiries: Stuart@UploadVR.com",
