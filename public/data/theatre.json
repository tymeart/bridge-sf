We know just how to fix it.\n\nSouth of Market: The Musical [v1.0 Alpha] is the musical comedy that’s disrupting the tech industry and answering important questions like:\n\n→ Have we reached peak saturation in the on-demand economy? Is there anything left to demand?\n→ Will venture capital money flow forever or will companies dry up like Tahoe?\n→ Is this too awkward for a first Bumble date? There’s a bar. So no. And it’s good fodder for conversation after.\n\nJoin the Bay Area community for an evening of musical theatre playing on modern tech culture in San Francisco.\n\nJokes will be A/B tested to improve laugh conversion rate.\n\nInterested in bringing the whole company?
