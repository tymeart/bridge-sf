  "description": "Israeli mezzo-soprano Maya Lahyani takes the stage with LINES Ballet for a world premiere collaboration. Called a “resplendent” vocalist by the San Francisco Chronicle, Lahyani is a soloist with the Metropolitan Opera and recipient of the prestigious Adler Fellowship at San Francisco Opera. Lahyani and the dancers are joined by guest artist Meredith Webster, a beloved LINES Ballet company member for nearly a decade, who returns to share a new solo by Alonzo King.\n\nThe fall home season also heralds the revival of Meyer, featuring a score by acclaimed classical bassist Edgar Meyer. Meyer has been hailed by the New Yorker as “the most remarkable virtuoso in the relatively un-chronicled history of his instrument.” In response to Meyer’s signature combination of bluegrass, jazz, folk, and classical music, King’s choreography — originally created for the company’s 30th anniversary — is alternately wistful and jubilant, infused with a playful sense of wonder. Set before Academy Award-winning designer Jim Doyle’s striking backdrop of synchronized water, Meyer is a lushly-textured landscape of movement and sound.\n\nSix performances only!\nWednesday, November 2 at 7:30pm\t\nThursday, November 3 at 7:30pm*\t\nFriday, November 4 at 8pm\nSaturday, November 5 at 8pm\t\nSunday, November 6 at 2pm*\nSunday, November 6 at 6pm\n\n*Post-performance talk with Alonzo King\n\nTickets start at $35 with a limited number of student tickets available for $25\n(November 3 and 6, 2pm matinee performances only)\nAll tickets are subject to dynamic pricing based on demand.\nPurchase early for best seats and prices.\n\n--\n\nBank of the West is the 2016 Season Sponsor for Alonzo King LINES Ballet. Alonzo King LINES Ballet benefits from the support of Bank of the West for the development of its projects.\n\nThe world premiere with Maya Lahyani was made possible, in part, by the Lisa and John Pritzker Family Fund.\n\nThe creation of Meyer was made possible with the generous support of the National Endowment for the Arts, Lisa and John Pritzker Family Fund, and The Bernard Osher Foundation.\n\nPhoto: RJ Muna",
